# hw-07-good-README-generator

First homework for backend work - This command-line application will prompt for the user's GitHub username along with various questions/text enters that the user wants to ask. The end goal of the application will generate a README.md file that the user can use. The questions that the user will be asked:

"What is your username?"
"What is the title that you want to name this project/repository?"
"Enter a description for this project."
"Create a table of contents."
"What will this project be used for?"
"What installations will be needed?"
"What licenses is required?"
"Any other contributions for this project that will be added?"
"Any tests."

This README.md can be used for whatever the user would like to utilize it for. A badge has not been added yet but is soon to come.
